This is a guide for the console, which is only usable in offline mode

* The console works on the object obj_wcmod
* The Pizza Tower font doesn't display all letters so you might make typos (shows with a red question mark)
* You can click a command in the console to repeat it

--CONTROLS--
	Hold left click and drag any object to move its position to the mouse
	Middle click to duplicate an object and drag it
	CTRL + Hold middle click (while dragging an object) to mass duplicate the object
	CTRL + Left click to teleport player 1 to the mouse
	Right click while dragging an object to delete it
	CTRL + Hold right click to mass delete objects
	ALT + Left click to "alt" drag an object (release left click to actually move it)

--COMMANDS LIST--
	Keycode 220 - Opens or closes the console
		(Rebind by doing "bind <key> openconsole")
	UP - Types previous command
	DOWN - Undoes UP
	CTRL + C - Copy command into clipboard
	CTRL + V - Paste text from clipboard
	CTRL + Backspace - Delete all text

	clear - Clears the console
	restartgame - Restarts the game
	endgame - Closes the game

	echo <text> - Makes the console say something
	sleep <miliseconds (number)> - Freezes the game for a set amount of miliseconds
	repeat <times> <command> - Repeats any command a specific amount of times (very big numbers can crash the game)

	swapfont - Swaps the font from the normal font to font0 to allow more characters (run again to undo)
	consolesize <size (number)> - Sets the vertical size for the console
		(minimum is 20, maximum is 540 (fullscreen) and default is 260)
	consolecolor <R> <G> <B> (0-255 numbers) - Sets the console's color
	prioritizebaddies - Toggles prioritizing baddies (toggle, on by default)
		(when ^ is active and you try dragging obj_baddiecollisionbox it drags the enemy instead)
	drag - Toggles dragging
	grid <size (number)> - Changes the creating / dragging grid, default is 1 (run again without the size argument to undo)
	saveconfig - Saves some console variables along with keybinds

	playsound <sound> (loop) - Plays a sound, works with indexes or sound names. If the second argument is "loop" it considers the sound as level music (applies music volume and loops)
	stopsound <sound> - Same as playsound but stops the sound instead (all instances of the sound)

	room <room> - Warps you to a room, works with indexes or room names
	restart - Restarts the current room
	speed <number> - Sets the maximum FPS for the current room

	create <object> (<x> <y>) - Spawns an object. If you don't provide the x and y you will have to create the object with your mouse
		(Left click to create the object, CTRL + hold left click to mass create and right click to exit out)
	instancelist - Lists all instances (objects) in the room

	state <state> - Sets the player's state
	char <character> (<sprites>) - Changes your character to the inputted string (P, N, V, S, etc) and optionally sets the sprites to a different character's
		(if you try a character that doesn't exist you might get weird results)

	variable (<object> <which> / global) <variable> <value> - Change a global / object's variable
	array (<object> <which> / global) <variable> <array index> <value> - Change a global / object's ARRAY variable, but for some reason can't set alarms

	oobcam - Toggle limitless camera

	panic (<minutes> <seconds>) - Toggle Pizza Time and optionally set the timer as well
	snickchallenge (<minutes> <seconds>) - Same as panic but it activates Snick Challenge

	freeze (<object> <which> / global) <variable> - Freezes / unfreezes a variable from an object
		(might not work as expected since it's impossible to actually freeze a variable in GameMaker)
	unfreezeall - Unfreezes all "frozen" variables

	showhidden - Shows invisible objects (if they don't have a sprite they show their name)

	script <object> <which> <script> (<arg0>, ... , <arg9>) - Executes a script on an object (can use up to 10 arguments) be aware that if a script requieres an argument and you miss it the game could crash
